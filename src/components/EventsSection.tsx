Inspect, explore, and uncover hidden secrets like a true cyber-sleuth. Sherlock vibes included. 🕵️‍♀️ Round 3 – Puzzle: Team Member 3 enters a puzzle website. Solve the mind-boggling challenges to reveal the final credentials. Warning: brain cramps guaranteed. 🧩 Round 4 – Final Task: Team Member 4 takes the final credentials and unlocks the ultimate surprise challenge. Fame, glory, and bragging rights await! 🏆 Why Join? Because Relayathon is the perfect mix of coding, puzzles, and chaotic fun. If you love teamwork, adrenaline, and proving your squad is the smartest (or funniest) on campus, this is your moment.
